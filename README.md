# Course Registration Project

### here are three key features of the project:

- Course Selection Control: Users can select courses to add to their cart while maintaining a maximum credit limit of 20.

- Real-time Price Calculation: The project provides users with a real-time update of the total price as they add courses to their cart. This dynamic pricing feature enhances transparency and helps users manage their budget effectively.

- Toast Notifications: The project uses toast notifications for user feedback, providing alerts for duplicate course selection or exceeding the credit limit.

### managed the state of my project.
Regarding the assignment project, I effectively managed the state using React's useState hook. I established state variables to monitor the selected courses, total credit hours, and the total price. These state variables responded dynamically to user interactions, like course selection or deselection. By adopting useState for state management, I ensured that the user interface always mirrors the current state of course selections and credit information, delivering an interactive and responsive user experience."# Course-Registration-Website"
